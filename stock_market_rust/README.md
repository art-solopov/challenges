## Description

Let's assume I'm playing the stock market - buy low, sell high. I'm a
day trader, so I want to get in and out of a stock before the day is
done, and I want to time my trades so that I make the biggest gain
possible.

The market has a rule that won't let me buy and sell in a pair of
ticks - I have to wait for at least one tick to go buy. And obviously
I can't buy in the future and sell in the past.

So, given a list of stock price ticks for the day, can you tell me
what trades I should make to maximize my gain within the constraints
of the market? Remember - buy low, sell high, and you can't sell
before you buy.
